Q5
Q5. Are there any outliers in the dataset? Identify any potential outliers using a boxplot and describe how they may impact your analysis.

By examining a boxplot, it is possible to identify potential outliers in the dataset. Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the distribution and may have a notable impact on the analysis. They can occur due to various reasons, such as data entry errors, measurement errors, or unusual observations.

To identify potential outliers using a boxplot, you can refer to the boxplot created in the previous question. Outliers in a boxplot are typically represented as individual points outside the whiskers (the lines extending from the boxes). If there are any data points beyond the whiskers, they can be considered potential outliers.

Upon observing the boxplot, you should look for any points that lie far outside the whiskers, both above and below. These points are potential outliers and may impact your analysis by skewing summary statistics, such as the mean and standard deviation.

It's important to investigate potential outliers further to determine their validity and potential impact on the analysis. Outliers might be legitimate data points that provide valuable insights or they could be erroneous values. Depending on the specific analysis and domain knowledge, you can decide whether to remove the outliers, transform the data, or handle them in a way that aligns with the goals of your analysis.

It's also worth noting that the presence of outliers does not necessarily indicate an issue with the data. Outliers can sometimes reflect real-world variations or exceptional cases. Properly understanding and interpreting outliers is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of your analysis.
